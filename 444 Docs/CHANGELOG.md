| 2026-02-10 | Structure | Created `_DL ROADMAP.md` for Deep Learning course progression. |
| 2026-01-29 | Structure | [COMPLETED] Major Vault Reorganization: <br>• **CSE**: Renamed folders to 'Digital Logic Design', 'Computer Architecture', 'Systems & Network Programming', 'Intro to VLSI Design', 'Embedded & Mobile Systems'. <br>• **ELE**: Created 'Fundamentals of Linear Systems'. <br>• **General**: Cleaned up into 'Meta', 'Projects', 'Math', 'General Physics II'. <br>• **CIS**: Organized Discrete Math, Logic, and Data Structures. |
| 2026-01-29 | Maintenance | [FIXED] Audit Findings: Renamed study guides, populated empty gate notes, added missing metadata to atomic notes. |
| 2026-01-29 | Enhancement | [UPDATED] Hamming Network: Reverted definition to match 'Deep Learning' presentation specific formulas (theta = -n/2). |
| 2026-01-29 | Enhancement | Contextual Linking: Added cross-links for proof techniques, probability sets, and OOP concepts. |
| 2026-01-29 | Presentation | Processed `Notes260129.pdf` (Deep Learning): Updated Hamming Network with lecture example. Created 'Simple Competitive Learning Network' and 'Reinforcement Learning'. |
| 2026-01-29 | Content | [EXPANDED] Reinforcement Learning: Added formal definitions (State, Action, Policy), introduced 'Exploration vs Exploitation' and 'n-armed bandit' atomic notes. |
| 2026-01-29 | Content | [UPDATED] Simple Competitive Learning: Added specific weight update rule (delta w = eta(i - w)) and input normalization context. |
| 2026-01-29 | Documentation | [UPDATED] Guidelines: Added strict 'Source Policy' to CLAUDE.md and vault_documentation.md. Course materials are the primary source of truth; external info is supplementary only. |
| 2026-01-29 | Enhancement | [UPDATED] Hamming Network: Added explicit matrix output formula (o = Wi + theta) and included Maxnet convergence example (Notes260129). |
