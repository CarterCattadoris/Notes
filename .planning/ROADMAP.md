# Project Roadmap: Obsidian Zettelkasten Evolution

**Overview**
This roadmap transforms the user's Obsidian vault into an automated knowledge engine. It builds a pipeline to extract content from academic sources (PDFs, PPTs), atomize it into Zettelkasten notes, and maintain high-level subject roadmaps for navigation—all without manual refactoring of legacy content.

**Phases:** 3
**Depth:** Quick
**Status:** Planning

---

## Phase 1: Extraction Engine
**Goal:** Users can convert raw PDFs and PPTs into clean Markdown with extracted assets.

**Dependencies**
- None (Foundation)

**Requirements**
- **EXT-01**: Extract text/tables from PDFs (Marker)
- **EXT-02**: Extract slides/notes from PPTX (python-pptx)
- **EXT-03**: Extract and hash images to `222 Files/`
- **EXT-04**: Convert equations to LaTeX

**Success Criteria**
1. User can run the extractor on a PDF and receive a Markdown file with preserved tables and layout.
2. User can run the extractor on a PPTX and see slides converted to text with speaker notes included.
3. User observes images and diagrams saved to `222 Files/` with SHA-256 filenames, referenced correctly in the Markdown.
4. User sees mathematical formulas in source documents rendered as valid LaTeX blocks in the output.

## Phase 2: Zettelkasten Integration
**Goal:** Users can automatically organize extracted content into a connected Zettelkasten structure.

**Dependencies**
- Phase 1 (Needs raw Markdown output)

**Requirements**
- **ZET-01**: Generate Source Note hubs
- **ZET-02**: Split content into atomic notes
- **ZET-03**: Generate YAML frontmatter
- **ZET-04**: Link atomic notes to Source Notes

**Success Criteria**
1. User sees a central "Source Note" created for each processed document that links to all derived parts.
2. User observes the raw content split into multiple atomic note files based on slide boundaries or headers.
3. User verifies that every new note contains correct YAML metadata (subject, date, source).
4. User can navigate from any atomic note back to its parent Source Note via a generated wiki-link.

---

## Phase 3: Roadmap Automation
**Goal:** Users have automatically maintained high-level subject maps for navigation.

**Dependencies**
- Phase 2 (Needs structured notes to map)

**Requirements**
- **MAP-01**: Initialize `_ROADMAP` files
- **MAP-02**: Inject new note links into roadmaps
- **MAP-03**: Hierarchical organization (Concept vs Sub-idea)
- **MAP-04**: Static link generation

**Success Criteria**
1. User finds a `_ROADMAP [Subject].md` file created automatically in subject folders if missing.
2. User sees newly created notes automatically appended or inserted into the correct subject roadmap.
3. User observes notes organized hierarchically (e.g., "Overarching Concepts" vs. "Sub-ideas") within the roadmap.
4. User can click links in the roadmap to navigate directly to notes, with no reliance on dynamic queries (Dataview) for core navigation.
