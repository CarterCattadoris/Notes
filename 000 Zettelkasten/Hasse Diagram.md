A Hasse diagram is a graphical representation of a finite poset (A, $\preceq$):
- Every element is represented by a node/vertex.
- There is an upward line segment drawn from node x to node y provided the following conditions all hold:
1 $x \preceq y$
2 $x \neq y$
3 There is no $w ∈ A − \{x, y\}$ such that $x \preceq w$ and $w \preceq y$
