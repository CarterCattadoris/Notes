1. let  A and B be 2 events in a sample space where $P(A) = \frac{2}{3}$, $P(B) = \frac{1}{6}$, and $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{9}$. What is $P(A \cup B)$?
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ = 2/3+1/6-1/9 = 13/18

2. Let C and D be 2 events for which one knows that $P(C) = 0.3$, $P(D) = 0.4$, and $P(C \cap B) = 0.2$. What is $P(C^c \cap D)$?
$P(C^c \cap D) = P(D) - P(C \cap D) = 0.4-0.2=0.2$
$P(D) = P(C \cap D) + P(C^c\cap D)$

3. Let A and B be 2 events. Suppose that $P(A) = 0.4$, $P(B) = 0.5$, and $P(A \cap B) = 0.1$. Find the probability that A or B occurs but not both
$P(A \cap B^c) + P(A^c \cap B) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7$

4. $\Omega = \{a,b,c,d\} \times \{a,b,c,d\}$
x, ab, ac, ad
ba, x, bc, bd
ca, cb, x, cd
da, db, dc, x

$\Omega = \{ (a,b), (a,c), (a,d),\dots , (d,c)\}$
6/12 = 1/2 chance that c is chosen

$P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) - P(A\cap B) - P(A \cap C) - P(B \cap C) + P(A \cap B \cap C)$$= P(A \cup B) + P(C) - P((A \cup B) \cap C$
