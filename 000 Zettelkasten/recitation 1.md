1. let  A and B be 2 events in a sample space where $P(A) = \frac{2}{3}$, $P(B) = \frac{1}{6}$, and $P(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{9}$. What is $P(A \cup B)$?
$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ = 2/3+1/6-1/9 = 13/18

2. Let C and D be 2 events for which one knows that $P(C) = 0.3$, $P(D) = 0.4$, and $P(C \cap B) = 0.2$. What is $P(C^c \cap D)$?
$P(C^c \cap D) = P(D) - P(C \cap D) = 0.4-0.2=0.2$
$P(D) = P(C \cap D) + P(C^c\cap D)$
3. Let A and B be 2 events. Suppose that $P(A) = 0.4$, $P(B) = 0.5$, and $P(A \cap B) = 0.1$. Find the probability that A or B occurs but not both
0.8
