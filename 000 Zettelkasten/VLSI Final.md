Previous T/F questions

In CMOS logical enffort analysis, the logical effort of a gate quantifies how much worse the gate is at producing output current compared to a reference inverter, assuming input capacitance: True

Flip flops are edge triggered storage elements that capture input data only on a specific clock transition, reducing transparency issues found in latches but increasing sensitivity: True

In a synchronous digital circuit, clock skew always improves timing margins by providing extra time for data to propagate between flip flops: False

For large operand sizes, a carry lookahead adder outperforms a ripple carry adder because it computes carry bits in parallel using generate and propagate logic, reducing carry chain delay from linear to log time: true

In CMOS gates, the intrinsic delay scales with each input and the load it drives, whereas the parasitic delay is a fixed property of gate topology independent of load: true

clock skew, caused by unequal path delays in clock distribution networks can lead to setup or hold time violations, hence, careful clock tree synthesis is essential in synchronous designs: true

in a cmos array multiplier, each partial product is directly summed using ripple carry adders, allowing for the fastest possible multiplications speed regardless of operand size: false
