(Object) $x$ is (term being defined) provided that it satisfies (specific conditions)

# Examples:
1. An integer $n$ is $even$ provided that there is an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k$
2. An integer $n$ is $odd$ provided that there is an integer $k$ such that $n = 2k + 1$

## Proof Formatting: 
1. Explicitly specify the claim you’re trying to prove. 
	1. Proposition: If n is an even integer, then n + 1 is odd.
2. Label the start of the proof, and indicate the method.
	2. Proof: (direct)
3. Explicitly state any initial assumptions/constraints.
	3. Suppose n is an even integer.
4. Explicitly state what you need to show, unwrapping the “stopping condition” as necessary.
	4. (Need to show: n + 1 is odd, which means there is an integer k such that $n + 1 = 2k + 1$.)
5. Fill in the gaps between steps 3 and 4 with the heart of the proof.
6. Explicitly wrap up the proof.
	5. Therefore, n + 1 is odd

### Example:
Proposition: If n is an even integer, then n + 1 is odd.
* Proof: (direct)
* Suppose n is an even integer. 
	- **Need to show: n + 1 is odd, which means there is an integer k such that n + 1 = 2k + 1.** 
* Because n is even, there exists an integer  such that n = 2. Therefore, n + 1 = 2+1, and hence there is an integer k (namely $l$) such that n + 1 = 2k + 1. 
* Therefore, n + 1 is odd.
