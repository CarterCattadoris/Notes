A postulate(axiom) is a statement that is assumed true, without proof

1. Axioms are typically very basic, fundamental statements about the objects they describe.
4. They serve as starting points from which other statements can be derived.
3. A standard axiom about the natural numbers: If n is a natural number, then n + 1 is also a natural number.
