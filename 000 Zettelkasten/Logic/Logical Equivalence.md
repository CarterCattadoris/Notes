Logical Equivalence: A and B are logically equivalent (A $\equiv$ B) iff their outputs are always the same regardless of input

Similar to [[Logical Consequence]], but more strict. Just because 2 terms are logically consequent doesn't mean they are logically equivalent. However if 2 terms are logically equivalent they are logically consequent.
