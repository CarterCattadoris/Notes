A definition in mathematics is a statement that stipulates the meaning of
a new term, symbol, or object:
- A definition specifies precisely what is meant by the term.
- A definition serves as the sole authority as to what that term means.
- Any subsequent statements regarding that term derive their meaning from the definition.

The standard form of a mathematics definition:
(Object) x is (term being defined) provided that it satisifies (specific conditions)
