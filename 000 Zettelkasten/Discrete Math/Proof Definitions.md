1. An integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that $n = 2k$.
2. An integer n is odd if there exists an integer k such that  $n = 2k + 1$.  
3. Let a and b be integers. We say that a is divisible by b (also: b divides a, or b is a factor of a, or b is a divisor of a) provided there is an integer c such that $bc = a$ We write $b|a$ to indicate that b divides a.
