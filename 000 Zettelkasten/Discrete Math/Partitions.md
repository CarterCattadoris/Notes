Let A be a set. A partition of A is a set of nonempty, pairwise disjoint sets whose union is A

Unwrapping the definition:
- A partition of A is a set of nonempty sets(called blocks or parts)
- Each block/part is a (nonempty) subset of A
- Pairwise disjoint: If X and Y are different blocks, then $X \cap Y = \emptyset$ (share no elements)
- The union of all the blocks is A
In a nutshell: Each block is a nonempty subset of A and each element of A shows up in exactly one block

Example:
- $\{ \{ V,Z \}, \{ W,Y \},\{ X \} \}$ is a partition of $\{ V,W,X,Y,Z \}$
