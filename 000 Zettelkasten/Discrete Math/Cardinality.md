The cardinality of a set A (written $|A|$) is the number of elements in A.

Set A is finite provided that $|A|$ is an integer, otherwise infinite

## Examples:
- |{1,8,5,3}| = 4
- |{1,8,1,5,3}| = 4 -> duplicates don't count
- |{}| = 0
- |{1, {8,5}, {7}}| = 3 -> set in a set is a singular element
- |{{}}| = 1 -> empty set in a set is still an element
