## A set is an unordered collection of object
- the objects in a set are called its [[Elements]] (or members)
- we write $x \in A$ to indicate that x is an element of set A
- we write $x \notin A$ to indicate that x is NOT an element of set A

### Common Sets:
- $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers
	- $1 \in \mathbb{Z}$
	- $2.1 \notin \mathbb{Z}$
- $\mathbb{Z}^+$, the set of positive integers
	- {$n \in \mathbb{Z}:n > 0$}
- $\mathbb{Z}^-$, the set of negative integers
- $\mathbb{N}$, the set of natural numbers
	- {$n \in \mathbb{Z}: n \geq 0$} -> includes 0
- $\mathbb{R}$, the set of real numbers
- $\mathbb{Q}$, the set of rational numbers

#### Notation:
- Roster notation: between braces
	- {1,4,5,10,17} -> Order of elements doesn't matter
	- {red, green, blue} -> Duplicate entries don't matter
- Set-builder notation: describe properties
	- {$y: y \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $y \leq 100$}
		- The set of those y such that y is in set Z and y <= 100
	- {$x : x \in \mathbb{R}$ : $x^3=x$}
		- The set of those x such that x is in set R and $x^3 = x$
