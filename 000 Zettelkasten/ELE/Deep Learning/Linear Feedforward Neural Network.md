[[Feedforward Neural Network]] where all neurons use linear activation functions

### Characteristics
- Output is linear combination of inputs
- No nonlinear transformations
- Equivalent to single layer regardless of depth

### Limitations
- Can only learn linearly separable patterns
- Multiple layers collapse to single layer mathematically
- Cannot solve XOR problem

### Applications
- [[Linear Regression]]
- Simple pattern matching
- Preprocessing layers

### Comparison
See [[Nonlinear Feedforward Neural Network]] for networks with nonlinear activations
