Learning paradigm where an agent learns through interaction with environment and reward signals

### Key Components
- **Agent**: The learner/decision maker
- **Environment**: What the agent interacts with
- **State**: Current situation
- **Action**: Choices available to agent
- **Reward**: Feedback signal (positive or negative)

### Learning Process
1. Agent observes current state
2. Takes action based on policy
3. Receives reward and new state
4. Updates policy to maximize cumulative reward

### Comparison to Other Paradigms
- [[Supervised Learning]]: Uses labeled examples
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]: Finds patterns without labels
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns from rewards/penalties

### Applications
- Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)
- Robotics control
- Autonomous vehicles
- Resource management
