**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

## Core Components
-   **Agent**: The learner or decision maker.
-   **Environment**: Everything the agent interacts with.
-   **State ($S$)**: The current situation of the agent.
-   **Action ($A$)**: What the agent does.
-   **Reward ($R$)**: Feedback signal (scalar) indicating success/failure.

## Goal
To maximize the expected cumulative reward over time.
