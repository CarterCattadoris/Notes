Learning paradigm where the network discovers patterns without labeled data

### Key Difference from Supervised
- No desired output $d$ provided
- Network finds structure in data autonomously

### Applications
- [[Clustering]] - grouping similar data
- Dimensionality reduction
- Feature extraction
- Density estimation

### Related Networks

- [[Competitive Learning Network]]
- Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

### Learning Methods
- [[K-Means Algorithm]]
- [[DBSCAN]]
- Hebbian learning
