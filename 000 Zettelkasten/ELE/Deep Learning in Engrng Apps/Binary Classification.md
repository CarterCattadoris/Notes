Classification task with exactly two classes

### Output
- Class 1: $y = +1$
- Class 2: $y = -1$

### Implemented by
- [[Perceptron]] - using step function
- Sigmoid neuron - outputs probability

### Decision Boundary
A hyperplane that separates the two classes
- In 2D: a line
- In 3D: a plane
- In nD: a hyperplane

### Limitation
Requires [[Linear Separability]] for single-layer networks

For non-linearly separable data, use:
- Multi-layer networks
- Kernel methods
