Grouping data points into clusters based on similarity - a form of [[Unsupervised Learning]]

### Graphical Methods
- Histograms (1D)
- Scatterplots (2D)
- Density estimation contour plots

### Algorithms
- [[K-Means Algorithm]] - partition-based
- [[DBSCAN]] - density-based
- Hierarchical clustering

### Distance Measures
- Euclidean distance: $d = \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i - y_i)^2}$
- [[Hamming Distance]] - for binary data
- Manhattan distance

### Applications
- [[Vector Quantization]]
- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection

### Feature Extraction
Important to select features that help create meaningful clusters
- Example: For vehicle handling, use 2wd/4wd, tire type, braking system
- NOT interior color or sound system
