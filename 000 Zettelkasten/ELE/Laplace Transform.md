Method to solve linear differential equations in engineering

Use [[Laplace Transform Table]], then use [[Partial Fractions]](if needed) to simplify. After, use [[Inverse Laplace Transform Table]] to convert back to time domain

For first order systems:
- Input: impulse -> no need for partial fractions
- Input: Step -> need partial fractions
