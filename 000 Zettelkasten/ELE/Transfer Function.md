Formally, the **Transfer Function** of a system is defined as:

$$H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}$$

* $H(s)$ is a commonly used notation for Transfer Function
* $X(s)$ is the **Laplace transform** of the system input $x(t)$,
* $Y(s)$ is the **Laplace transform** of the system output $y(t)$.
* The system assumes **Zero initial condition** 
* For consistency, make the coefficient of the highest degree term int the denominator 1
