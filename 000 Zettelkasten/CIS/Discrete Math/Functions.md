A **function** is a special type of [[Binary Relations|relation]] where each input maps to exactly one output.

A relation f is a function provided that
	for all $a,b,c, \space if (a,b) \in f$ and $(a,c) \in f,$ then $b=c$
(That is, no object a appears as the first component of two different pairs.)

### Examples:  
- $f_{1} = \{(1, 2), (2, 5), (4, 5), (10, −37)\}$ is a function.  
- $f_{2} = \{(1, 2), (2, 5), (4, 5), (2, −37)\}$ is not a function.  
- $g = \{(Lee, B), (Jones, A), (Cook, D), (Blake, B)\}$ is a function.  
- $h = \{(x, x_{2}) : x ∈ N\}$ and $k = \{(x, x2) : x ∈ Z\}$ are functions.  
- $L = \{(x_{2}, x) : x ∈ Z\}$ is not a function

## Types of Functions
- [[Injections (1-1)]] - One-to-one functions
- [[Surjections (onto)]] - Onto functions
- [[Bijections]] - Both one-to-one and onto
