An **equivalence relation** on set A is a [[Binary Relations|relation]] that is [[Reflexivity|reflexive]], [[Symmetric|symmetric]], and [[Transitivity|transitive]].

## Required Properties

1. **[[Reflexivity]]** - Every element is related to itself
2. **[[Symmetric]]** - If a is related to b, then b is related to a
3. **[[Transitivity]]** - If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c

## Related Concepts
- [[Equivalence Classes]] - Partition created by equivalence relations
- [[Partitions]] - Equivalence relations induce partitions
- [[Binary Relations]]
