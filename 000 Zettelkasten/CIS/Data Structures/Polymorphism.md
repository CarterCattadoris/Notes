**Polymorphism** refers to determining which program behavior to execute depending on data types.

## Types

**Compile-time polymorphism:** Method overloading wherein the compiler determines which of several identically-named methods to call based on the method's arguments.

**Runtime polymorphism:** The determination is made while the program is running rather than at compile time.
