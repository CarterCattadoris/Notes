**Inheritance** allows one [[Classes|class]] (a subclass) to be based on another class (a base class or superclass).

## Example

A Shape class may encapsulate data and behavior for geometric shapes, like setting/getting the Shape's name and color, while a Circle class may be a subclass of a Shape, with additional features like setting/getting the center point and radius.
