Polymorphism refers to determining which program behavior to execute depending on data types. Method overloading is a form of **compile-time polymorphism** wherein the compiler determines which of several identically-named methods to call based on the method's arguments. Another form is **runtime polymorphism** wherein the compiler cannot make the determination but instead the determination is made while the program is running.
