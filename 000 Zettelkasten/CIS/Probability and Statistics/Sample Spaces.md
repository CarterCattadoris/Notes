A **sample space** (denoted Ω) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

## Definition

$$\Omega = \{\text{all possible outcomes}\}$$

## Examples

**Coin toss:**
$$\Omega = \{H, T\}$$

**Die toss:**
$$\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$$

## Key Properties

- Every outcome belongs to exactly one sample space
- The sample space contains every possible result of an experiment
- $P(\Omega) = 1$ (probability of some outcome occurring is certain)

## Relation to Events

An [[Events (Probability)|event]] is a subset of the sample space. For a die toss:
- Event A (odd numbers): $A = \{1, 3, 5\}$
- Event B (even numbers): $B = \{2, 4, 6\}$

## Types

- **Finite sample spaces**: Discrete outcomes (coin, die)
- **[[Infinite Sample Spaces]]**: Countably infinite outcomes (number of tosses until heads)
