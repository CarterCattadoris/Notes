Java provides several wrapper classes that are built-in reference types that augment the primitive types. The Integer data type is a built-in class in Java that augments the int primitive type. Ex: Integer maxPlayers = 10; declares an Integer reference variable named maxPlayers that refers to an instance of the Integer class, also known as an Integer object. That Integer object stores the integer value 10.
