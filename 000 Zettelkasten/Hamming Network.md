Distance computation and comparison are essential to unsupervised
learning networks. In most of the previous examples we’ve seen the
Euclidean distance used. One of the most efficient versions utilizes the
Hamming distance

$H(i_{1, i_{2}}) =$ # of bits where $i_{1,j} \& i_{2,j}$ have different binary values

ex: $i_{1}$ = 1 0 1 0
$i_{2}$ = 1 1 0 1
