A fair die is thrown twice. A is the event "sum of the throws equals 4" and B is "at least one of the throws is a 3"

calculate $P(A | B)$
$P(A) = \frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$
$P(B) = \frac{12}{36} = \frac{1}{3}$
$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{2}{36}}{\frac{12}{36}} = \frac{1}{18}$
$P(A \cap B) = \{ (1,3), (3,1) \} = \frac{2}{36}$

Are A and B independent events?
no, $P(A) \neq P(A|B)$
