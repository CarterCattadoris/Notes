# Final Vault Audit Report

## 1. Corrections Verified
The following issues from the previous audit have been **FIXED**:
- ✅ **Renamed**: `CSE 384 Final Study Guide.md` (was `Untitled.md`).
- ✅ **Metadata Added**: `Propositional Logic Terms.md` and `College.md` now have timestamps and status.
- ✅ **Populated**: `NAND Gate.md` and `NOR Gate.md` are no longer empty.

## 2. Status Summary
- **Vault Organization**: All files are in their correct `CSE`, `ELE`, `CIS`, or `General` subfolders.
- **Reference Files**: `CLAUDE.md` and `vault_documentation.md` are updated.
- **Changelog**: Consolidate and up-to-date.

## 3. Remaining Minor Items (Expected)
The following files are flagged but are likely acceptable as-is:
- **No Outgoing Links**: `Identity Relations.md`, `Inverse Relations.md` (Atomic definitions).
- **Raw Data**: Homework files, Exams, and the large Study Guide do not follow strict Zettelkasten formatting.

**Vault Condition: GREEN / HEALTHY**
