For each of the following relations, determine whether or not it is a function, and support
your answer as follows:
• If it is not a function, provide a brief but compelling explanation why not.
• If it is a function, give its domain and image (make sure you label your answers).
a. $\{(2, 4), (4, 5), (3, 4), (4, 6), (7, 2)\}$ 
	not a function, 4 maps to 5 and 6
b. $\{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (6, 4), (9, 3), (5, 7)\}$
	is a function
c. $\{(2n + 3, n) : n ∈ N\}$
	is a function
d. $\{(x^{2}, x) : x ∈ Z\}$
	not a function, 1 maps to -1 and 1


2. Suppose $C = \{1, 3, 5\}$, $D = \{2, 4\}$, and $E = \{6, 7, 8\}$.
a. List all of the onto functions from C to D.
	$\{ (1,2),(3,2),(5,4) \}$
	$\{ (1,2),(3,4),(5,2) \}$
	$\{ (1,2),(3,4),(5,4) \}$
	$\{ (1,4),(3,2),(5,2) \}$
	$\{ (1,4),(3,2),(5,4) \}$
	$\{ (1,4),(3,4),(5,2) \}$
b. List all of the 1-1 functions from D to E.
$\{(2,6), (4,7)\}$
$\{(2,6), (4,8)\}$
$\{(2,7), (4,6)\}$
$\{(2,7), (4,8)\}$
$\{(2,8), (4,6)\}$
$\{(2,8), (4,7)\}$
c. List all of the bijections from E to C.
$\{(6,1), (7,3), (8,5)\}$
$\{(6,1), (7,5), (8,3)\}$
$\{(6,3), (7,1), (8,5)\}$
$\{(6,3), (7,5), (8,1)\}$
$\{(6,5), (7,1), (8,3)\}$
$\{(6,5), (7,3), (8,1)\}$

3. For each of the following functions, determine (i) whether or not it is 1-1, (ii) whether or not it is onto, and (iii) whether or not it is a bijection.

a. $f_{1} : Z → Z$ defined by $f_{1}(n) = 2n^2 + 1$
1-1:no,$f_{1}(2) = 9$, and $f_{1}(-2)=9$
onto: only makes positive odd numbers, so negative numbers arent touched
bijective:no, not 1-1 or onto
b. $f_{2} : N → Z$ defined by $f_{2}(n) =\{ \frac{-n}{2}$ if n is even $\frac{n+1}{2}$ if n is odd}
1-1:yes
onto:yes
bijection:yes
c. $f_{3} : N → N$ defined by $f_{3}(n) = n + 3$
1-1:yes
onto:no, doesn't hit 1,2,3
bijection:no, not onto
d. $f_{4} : Z × Z → Z$ defined by $f_{4}(m, n) = m + n$
1-1:no, (1,2) = 3, (2,1) = 3
onto:yes
bijection:no, not 1-1
e. $f_{5} : R × R → R × R$ defined by $f_{5}(x, y) = (x − y, x + y)$
1-1: yes
onto: yes
bijection: yes
